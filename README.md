# bash-game-of-life
This is my attempt at creating Conway's Game of Life in a bash shell script

Enter the number of generations, you'd like to run through and press enter at the >>> prompt to continue to the next generation.
Entering "s" will save the board's state to a numbered "board##.txt" file.
Entering "q" will break out of the loop and quit the script.
